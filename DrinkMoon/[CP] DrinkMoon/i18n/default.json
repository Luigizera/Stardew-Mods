I also grabbed some extra things to eat during our trip in our Misery Machine (Van), as well as downloading some offline games on my cell phone to play with Guilherme, time to camp! :D#Day 2 Week 1 - We're Lost - I got scammed, the app took us to another part of the world and now we're lost in a village and no signal, and worst of all our car broke down... I don't know if we'll make it back, for now, our best choice is to do some activities to get money, honestly I don't want to do anything. >:(#Day 3 Week 1 - Getting to Know the People - Talked a bit with the Saloon people after I won Guilherme for the 10th time, Gus seems like a funny guy, and his mustache is cool, will mine look like that too? I can't wait! :)#Day 4 Week 1 - Unexpected Letter - This morning I woke up with the mayor bringing me a letter, I thought it was a little strange at first... I looked at what was written and, who wrote this?! After deciphering the letter's code, I went to the marked location and discovered an infinity of possibilities! Hats, hats everywhere! Who knew I would be delighted by something like this! :O#Day 5 Week 1 - Someone special - I recently met someone, but it was different from everyone I had talked to... I was finally able to express myself in a light and relaxed way, I hope to talk more with this person in other days! :3",

'O'#Day 12 Week X - What a day! - Today I managed to talk to the people and they agreed to be part of my hat event! Well, if they didn't come I was going to have to make them come by force anyway, after all, I already bought the hats. XD#Day 4 Week X - How Careless! - Today I did my hat event, and it was fun in a way! Seeing people using their creativity to match the hat was quite interesting. My only regret is telling people about the hat situation... but if I hadn't, I wouldn't have gotten together with that person, so I guess it was totally worth it in the end! I just regret not being able to talk about how I feel... D:#Day 3 Week X - A special day! - Today that person asked me to date... that was a surprise, because I was also going to do the same thing, I don't know when, but I was! I think that in the end this trip was really worth it, I got to meet a lot of new people and I got used to living in the valley, I think they already consider me part of the community!
